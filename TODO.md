# To do

- Add an appropriate licence (MIT? CC? etc)
- Add Node environment settings
- Describe setting up the development environment and associated tasks
- Convert to packages.json for relevent dependencies
- Separate source files from distribution files. i.e. `src` and `build` separation.
- Add favicon.ico

# Consider

- Moving to Sass for CSS pre-processing, or abandoning CSS pre-processing altogether.
- Removing Bootstrap as a CSS dependency. It's not doing much but bloating the browser render.
- Adding humans.txt or a reference to the Github repo.
- Add opengraph attributes

# Bugfixes and improvements

- Fix the jump-to-section rendering bugs
- Improve rendering performance
- Add HTML5 semantic elements where possible

# Investigate

- Improve the markup by adding content initially
